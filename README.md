# more
Tired of less' bad warpping that splits words in half at the end of lines? More, named after the classical Unix utility & written in just two lines of shell, is a less with proper formatting, using less & fmt.

# Installation
You can either alias it in your shell rc file or move it a bin directory and rename it to "more". The latter will, however, replace the original "more" that is installed on your computer.
